<p><strong>2020</strong> was not good. Despite the fact that he attained several big goals such as gettimng in to the uni of manchester, he actually felt something missing. Probably, that's mainly because he was back in Korea for so long, merely waiting the bloody pandemic to be done and going back to the UK in which he was supposed to be staying.
</p>
<center><p>Nevertheless, he still had his precious friends.</p></center>
