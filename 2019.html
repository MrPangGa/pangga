<p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrpangga17/" target="_blank" title="PangGa's Instagram">PangGa</a>'s 2019</strong> was the beginning of his life's new stage; his university life in the UK. <br>Nothing but the truth was that his feeling was full of anxiety as well as looking forward to the life that he has never experienced for the past 21 years.
When he first arrived in the Manchester Airport, he immediately felt the weather in Manchester isn't that bad as he anticipated. It was sunny and cozy.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:10px">However, as the first month passed, the weather became so bad that PangGa barely could see the sunshine in the morning, deadly missing his besties and families, whilst being fed up with the all the shits in Manchester. Listening to racists' shit has become a weekly event to him, the average quality of the foods never dared to compared with Korean foods, and, most importantly, the people he lived with were so rude and filthy that he could never see them cleaning up their wastes. </p>
<p>He really missed the precious moments with his best friends.</p>
